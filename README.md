All my stuff related to Harvard's CS50 course on edX

This repo contains all my work for Harvards CS course done thorugh edX platform. 

Pset0 (Week 0): A simple game similar to the Space War Game developed with Scratch.

Pset1 (Week 1): Introduction into C language. There were three projects to be done of which "credit" was the most interesting one. For instance I had to create a program that checks the validity of a credit card. If it turned out to be a valid card by the definition of Luhn's algorithm, the program will return either AMEX, VISA or MASTERCARD as the issuer of that card. 

Pset2 (Week 1, continued): This week was all about cryptography. I had to implement Caesar's and Vigenère's encryption method. Currently also working on the problem set "crack" which requires you to crack a bunch of passwords from given hashes. 

Pset3 (Week 2): Week 2's topic was sorting and search algorithms. The 3rd problem set "music" was about making your PC read music sheets and making it play your (favourite) piano song. It is known (because people have actually agreed upon this) that the note A4 (note A in the 4th octave) on a piano has a frequency of 440 Hz. The frequencies of one octave’s notes differ from those of adjacent octaves' notes by a factor of two. E.g. the note A5 will have a frequency of 880 Hz (twice the frequency of A4). Based on that piece of information, I was now able to calculate the frequency of any note and thus make the PC play a song for me.
